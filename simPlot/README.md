# COMSOL Post-Processing
Respective to studies concerning the ‘Electromagnetic Waves, Frequency Domain’ (emw) 
interface in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5, this program plots 2-column '.txt' files for 'S-parameters' (Results)
more transferably, scaling axes to input data based on S-parameter relative minima and maxima.
