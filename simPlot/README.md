# COMSOL Post-Processing
Respective to studies concerning the ‘Electromagnetic Waves, Frequency Domain’ (emw) 
interface in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5, this program plots 2-column '.txt' files for 'S-parameters' (Results)
more transferably, scaling the y-axis to each input data file.

12/8/21: Added 'hard_code.py', an unautomated processing script solely intended to compare
experimental with simulated S-parameters.
